## Prompt 1: Initial Multi-Model VLCC Cycle-Peak Valuation
**Date**: March 1, 2026

Translate the following Chinese prompt into English and run it across multiple AI models (GPT, Opus 4.6, and other good models), then compile a comparative report:

Rules for VLCC cycle-peak valuation backtest of DHT and FRO:
1. **Data standards**: Use latest real fleet numbers. Frontline is a mixed fleet — convert to VLCC-equivalents (VLCC=1.0, Suezmax=0.5, Aframax=0.3). Account for scale effects. All historical market caps CPI-adjusted to 2026 USD.
2. **Cycle positioning**: 2008 = super cycle; 2020 = floating storage pulse; 2026-2028 = supply-driven strong cycle between 08 and 20. Use mid-to-upper-range per-vessel market cap.
3. **Calculate**: Inflation-adjusted per-VLCC-eq market cap at cycle peaks. Current fleet × VLCC-eq. Conservative/neutral/optimistic target market caps. Upside vs current price. Conclusion: who has more elasticity, who has better risk/reward.
4. **Output**: Concise, model-ready, no contradictions.

## Prompt 2: Bullish Thesis Enhancement
**Date**: March 1, 2026

Fix Gemini 3 Pro's empty output. Enhance the analysis with current bullish market conditions:
- VLCC supply is very limited
- Sinokor is holding a large portion of fleet
- No new VLCC supply until late 2028
- Shadow fleet is exiting the market
- Market price will keep going up and break historic highs after inflation adjustment

## Prompt 3: Documentation & Translation
**Date**: March 1, 2026

Summarize the conversation into .md files. Create a Chinese version of the .md and translate results into Chinese. Put everything in one folder.

---

## Prompt 4: Market Cap Update
**Date**: March 1, 2026

Market cap has changed significantly since beginning of 2026. Fetch the latest market cap of FRO and DHT and update all files.

---

## Prompt 5: Cross-Language Data Alignment
**Date**: March 1, 2026

Chinese version report has bad data. Compare English vs Chinese version. English looks more accurate but do a self-check. Make sure numbers are aligned across both languages.

---

## Prompt 6: Fundamental Deep-Dive
**Date**: March 2, 2026

Both stocks have incredibly similar 3-month stock price trajectories (bottomed then doubled in 2 months). But the model shows DHT has significantly higher upside than FRO, which doesn't make sense. Do a deep dive on both companies — fetch public reports on both companies and the VLCC industry — and figure out why. Propose potential explanations.

---

## Prompt 7: Day1Global Framework Application
**Date**: March 2, 2026

Search for `tech-earnings-deepdive` skill on GitHub and add its framework to the analysis.

---

## Prompt 8: Operating Leverage ("SaaS Economics") + OPEC Reality Check
**Date**: March 2, 2026

Two new analytical dimensions:

1. **Operating leverage / SaaS economics**: VLCC profit behaves like SaaS — 10% revenue increase can lead to exponentially higher profit because TCO (total cost of ownership) is essentially fixed. Do a back-trace on VLCC, Suezmax, and LR2. Think deeply and adjust the report.

2. **OPEC production reality check**: OPEC announced production increases don't mean actual increases — like Fed liquidity, there are monthly adjustments and compensatory cuts that offset announcements. The "frontloading" of announced vs actual production. Do a thorough check on actual production, compare to 2008/2020 big cycles, and find the real OPEC output numbers.

---

## Prompt 9: Target Price Section
**Date**: March 2, 2026

The report is missing the most important part: **target prices**. Use the current report as reference, run across different models, and add a target price section with guidance.

---

## Prompt 10: GitHub Deployment
**Date**: March 2, 2026

Push the whole repo to GitHub (`liqiqiii`). Create a GitHub Page for the Chinese deep-dive report (`06_Deep_Dive_Day1Global_Framework_CN.md`).

---

## Prompt 11: Session History Summary
**Date**: March 2, 2026

Go through the chat history in this project. Summarize exactly what I proposed for the report, list them out. Then translate the summary into Chinese.

---

## Prompt 12: Charter Strategy Analysis
**Date**: March 2-3, 2026

Analyze the charter structure differences between DHT and FRO — spot/TC/FFA strategy differences. Generate charts comparing sensitivity, elasticity, and stability of both companies to VLCC rate changes. Run across multiple models. Summarize conclusions and add to existing report framework.

---

## Prompt 13: Charter Data Cross-Check
**Date**: March 3, 2026

Data discrepancy: Other sources show booking rates as DHT 66/34 and FRO 92/8 (locked = TC + spot long-term bookings + FFA). Cross-check this data against the charter type split used in the model.

**Findings**: Two different metrics were being confused — booking rate (% of Q1 days contracted) vs charter type (structural spot/TC split). Also discovered DHT is shifting from 54% spot to 75% spot by Q2 2026. Update all reports with corrected data.

## Prompt 15: Chinese A-Share VLCC Analysis (招商轮船 vs 中远海能)
**Date**: March 4, 2026

Using the same prompt framework, same report structure, and same skills (Day1Global, multi-model, operating leverage, target prices), run the same analysis for 招商轮船 (CMES, 601872.SH) and 中远海能 (COSCO Energy, 600026.SH). Create a separate report since these are from a different stock market (A-share). Additionally:
- Take the 中远海控 (COSCO Holdings, 601919.SH) container cycle (2020-2022) into consideration, focusing on PE/PB ratio compression at cycle peaks as a reference
- Predict the annual income for 2026 for both VLCC companies
- Run across 5 models (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro) and summarize

**Key findings**:
- Both rated STRONG BUY by all 5 models
- CMES: 12M base target RMB 25 (+41%), dividend safety (40% payout)
- COSCO Energy: 12M base target RMB 32 (+35%), LNG defensive floor
- Critical sensitivity correction: RMB 730M per $10K/day (not $1K/day)
- A-share VLCC stocks trade at 2.5-3x premium per VLCC vs US-listed peers (DHT/FRO)

---

## Prompt 16: Full-Portfolio Earnings Recalculation
**Date**: March 4, 2026

The 2026 earnings model only accounted for VLCC segment uplift. Both CMES (~280 ships across 5 segments) and COSCO Energy (~185 ships including 18 Suezmax + 50 Aframax/LR2 + 30 MR/LR1) have major non-VLCC fleets that also benefit from the tanker super-cycle. Recalculate using:
- Each tanker segment separately (VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax/LR2, MR/LR1) with current market rates
- Dry bulk (Capesize $26K/day) and LNG (long-term contracts) for CMES
- Same method as DHT/FRO analysis for product tanker segments

**Key findings**:
- COSCO Energy earnings 28-37% higher than VLCC-only model (non-VLCC tankers add RMB 1.5-4.5B)
- COSCO base NI: RMB 17.3B (was 13.5B), PE 7.8x (was 10.0x)
- CMES base NI: RMB 14.7B (was 13.7B), PE 9.7x (was 10.5x)
- Full-portfolio model significantly favors COSCO Energy on pure earnings upside

---

## Prompt 16b: Cross-Market Comparison Fix
**Date**: March 4, 2026

The per-VLCC valuation comparison with US peers was misleading — divided total market cap by VLCC count ignoring 200+ non-VLCC ships. Fixed with 4 methods: per-total-vessel (CMES is cheapest at 0.54x DHT), SOTP segment isolation (1.2-1.6x premium, not 2.5-3x), PE comparison, and hidden value analysis.

---

## Prompt 17: $150K Base Scenario Modeling
**Date**: March 4, 2026

Model an alternative scenario where the 2026 VLCC average rate baseline is $150K/day instead of $100K/day. Add a new section (4B) comparing the two baselines side-by-side. Shows how sell-side consensus lag creates hidden value.

**Key findings**:
- At $150K base: CMES PE drops from 14.3x → 9.7x, COSCO from 13.5x → 7.8x
- COSCO NI jumps +73% (vs +47% for CMES) — benefits more from diversified tanker fleet
- CMES dividend yield rises to 4.1% (from 2.8%)
- "The question is not IF rates stay at $150K — they already ARE there"

---



## Prompt 18: Full-Report Dual-Scenario Consistency
**Date**: March 4, 2026

Section 4B was added for the $150K scenario, but the rest of the report (TL;DR, Section 5, Section 9 especially) was NOT updated to include $100K/$150K/$200K comparison. Go through the WHOLE report and update every section with dual-scenario target prices, PE, and investment advice. Section 9 (investment recommendation) is the most important — must show scenario-specific targets, buy/sell triggers, and allocation advice.

Also add this as a standing rule in RULES.md: whenever a new scenario or assumption is added, update ALL sections referencing affected metrics, not just a standalone section.

**Key changes**:
- TL;DR: Now shows $100K and $150K PE side-by-side, dual target prices
- Section 5: Dual-scenario consensus targets (Scenario A vs B)
- Section 9: Completely overhauled into 9A-9F with full $100K/$150K/$200K matrix
- Section 9B: Scenario-specific investment verdict (what to do under each assumption)
- Section 9E: Key triggers and milestones to watch
- Appendix: Forward PE table now shows 3 scenarios across 4 companies
- RULES.md: Added Rule 14 (whole-file scenario consistency)


## Prompt 19: Day1Global Framework Retroactive Application
**Date**: March 4, 2026

User noticed the Day1Global tech-earnings-deepdive framework (used in DHT/FRO report) was not listed in RULES.md and was not applied to the A-share report. Decision: Add as mandatory rule AND retroactively apply to A-share report.

**Added to A-share report (Sections 10-13):**
- Module C: Cash Flow — CMES FCF yield 9.8-11.2% at $150K (Grade A-), COSCO flips FCF-positive (Grade B+)
- Module L: Ownership — Both SOEs ~47-49% state-owned, COSCO has higher related-party risk
- Module O: Accounting Quality — CMES cleaner (A-), COSCO watch related-party transactions (B)
- 6 Investment Perspectives: Quality Compounder→CMES, Growth→COSCO, Long/Short→both longs (50-70% gap), Deep Value→CMES safer, Catalyst→Q1 earnings (April), Macro→overweight both
- Anti-Bias Framework: 6 cognitive traps identified and mitigated
- Pre-Mortem: 4 scenarios (Hormuz, capex trap, recession, A-share systemic), combined 40%+ drawdown probability 35-45%

**RULES.md: Added Rule 15** — Day1Global framework is mandatory for all stock analysis reports.

## Prompt 20: Framework Decoupling (Common vs Industry-Specific)
**Date**: March 4, 2026

Decouple RULES.md and prompt logs into universal (reusable for any industry) vs VLCC-specific. Create separate framework/ folder with:
- UNIVERSAL_RULES (EN/CN) - 14 common rules (bilingual, multi-model, Day1Global, scenario consistency)
- REUSABLE_PROMPTS (EN/CN) - 10 prompt templates with [PLACEHOLDER] syntax
- Original RULES.md and Prompt_Log files remain unchanged (project-specific)

---


## Prompt 21: Cyclical Stock Rules (Two-Cycle Backtrack)
**Date**: March 4, 2026

Create cyclical-stock-specific rules in the framework/ folder. Key additions:
- **CRule 1 (Two-Cycle Backtrack)**: For every cyclical stock, find the two most recent cycles, backtrack stock price vs commodity/rate correlation (R-squared, lead/lag), map current position to historical cycle anatomy, and predict where we are now.
- CRule 2-10: PE compression patterns, supply-demand duration, operating leverage multiplier, contrarian timing indicators, cross-cycle reference, earnings sensitivity matrix, exit strategy framework, inflation-adjusted comparison, shadow/grey market monitoring.

User's specific rule (CRule 1): "Find the two most recent cycles, do a backtrack of stock price vs raw material rate (e.g., tungsten price, VLCC rate). See the correlation, give basic analysis based on past cycles, predict where we are in the cycle now based on historical data."

*This file will be updated as new prompts are added. Last updated: March 4, 2026.*
### Prompt 22 (March 4, 2026) — Unified Copilot Instructions Skill File
**Request**: Merge all rule files (Universal 14 rules + Cyclical 10 CRules + Project 5 P-Rules + 5 Prompt Templates) into a single .github/copilot-instructions.md that Copilot auto-reads. Add auto-detection logic: always apply universal rules, auto-activate cyclical rules if company is in a cyclical industry.
**Result**: Created .github/copilot-instructions.md with 3-layer hierarchy (Universal > Cyclical > Project-Specific), auto-detection logic, combined checklists, and reusable prompt templates. Single file replaces the need to manually reference framework/ files.
### Prompt 23 (March 4, 2026) - China Tungsten High-Tech (000657.SZ) Analysis
**Request**: Using the unified copilot-instructions.md framework (Universal + Cyclical Rules), run a full analysis on a non-shipping cyclical stock: China Tungsten High-Tech (000657.SZ). Apply CRule 1-10 (Two-Cycle Backtrack, PE Compression, Operating Leverage, Earnings Sensitivity, etc.). Use 5 models, create separate folder, GitHub Pages integration.
**Result**: Created tungsten/ folder with EN/CN reports. All 5 models independently rated SELL/TAKE PROFIT. Key findings: APT at ALL-TIME HIGH (RMB 810K/ton, 4x 2024), stock +600% 1yr, PE 135x (vs 13-25x historical peak), forward PE 35x at spot still above historical. Prob-weighted 12M return -30% to -39%. Cycle position: Deep Phase 4 (Mania). First non-shipping application of the cyclical framework.
